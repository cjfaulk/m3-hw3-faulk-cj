This Stack Overflow chain to figure out how to put the opacity on the background image: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36679649/how-to-add-a-color-overlay-to-a-background-image/36679903

Issues:
The only issue that I ran into was the 33% opacity on the color overlay for the Hero Background image that was listed in the style guide. It did not look as dark as the opacity on the mockup, so I increased the opacity on it.
I also did had to do some trial and error with Bootstrap and Less because I am still getting the hang of those.
